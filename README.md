**Paying Guest Management System**

**Introduction:**
The goal of the Paying Guest Management System project is to make renting easier for both hosts and visitors. It offers a single, centralized location for room advertising, reservations, payments, and reviews, guaranteeing effective administration and improved communication amongst all stakeholders.

**Background Study:**
A software program called the Paying Guest Management System enables hosts to centrally manage their tenants and lodging information. Admin, guest, and host are the three different user types in the system. A room's details, which can be changed, active, or deleted, can be posted by the host. When the designated room is unoccupied, a visitor can make a reservation, and the reservation status becomes booked. The admin receives the booking request. The booking request may be accepted or denied by the admin. The guest can check in on the check-in page once the booking room information are displayed, provided the admin approves the booking request. The booking status will be empty if the administrator rejects the request.The booking status will become empty once the guest checks out of the room. The guest and host can exchange reviews once they have checked out.With the transaction ID and bKash number, the visitor can settle the accommodation bill. The request for payment is made to the administrator to confirm the payment details. All data is saved and displayed in the host and guest dashboard's history once the admin approves the payment. It will once more appear on the guest dashboard to input data if the admin rejects the payment. The host may ask the administrator for a payment withdrawal if the visitor pays the rent for the designated advertised accommodation.The administrator will give the host the desired amount of money. To sum up, the mechanism for paying guests facilitates a more efficient booking, payment, and checkout process, hence simplifying the stay management process for both hosts and guests. The framework permits reviews to be shared between hosts and guests as well, offering insightful input for upcoming changes. All things considered, the paying guest management system is a great resource for anyone trying to run their rental properties more successfully.
